### 1. [Mandelbrot-set](https://github.com/M87K452b/Mandelbrot-set)
This program computes mandelbrot set (a fractal) for a given set of co-ordinates.

### 2. [Logistic Map & Bifircation plot](https://github.com/M87K452b/logistic-map-plot)
This program computes the logistic map equation and plots the chaotic nature of such a second degree polynomial.

### 3. [Project Euler - Solutions so far](https://github.com/M87K452b/project-euler/blob/main/README.md)
**This repository remains private following the project guide lines.**
*  Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
