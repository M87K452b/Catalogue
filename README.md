### 3. [Project Euler - Solutions so far](https://github.com/M87K452b/project-euler/blob/main/README.md)
**In the spirit of not spoiling the fun, this repository remains private**
*  Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
