## Python-Projects

### 1. [Mandelbrot-set](https://github.com/M87K452b/Mandelbrot-set)
This program computes mandelbrot set (a fractal) for a given set of co-ordinates.

### 2. [Logistic Map & Bifircation plot](https://github.com/M87K452b/logistic-map-plot)
This program computes the logistic map equation and plots the chaotic nature of such a second degree polynomial.

### 3. [Project Euler - Solutions so far](https://github.com/M87K452b/project-euler)
**In the spirit of not spoiling the fun, this repository remains private**
*  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

### 4. [Plotting Prime numbers](https://github.com/M87K452b/plotting-primes)
* Plotting prime numbers on polar coordinates inspired by a video done on 3b1b

### 5. [Lattice Boltzmann Modelling for Flow around an obstacle](https://github.com/M87K452b/LatticeBoltzmann-flowaroundobstacle)
* Computation of flow around an obstacle using Lattice-Boltzmann method which is based on lattice gas automata.

### 6. [Estimate-Pi](https://github.com/M87K452b/Estimate-Pi)
**This code is an interactive application that estimates the value of pi using the unit square unit circle method.**
